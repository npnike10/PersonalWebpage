We introduce state-dependent price of anarchy (sPoA) metric, that extends the well-known game theoretical metric, PoA, to Markov games. We also empirically show the benefit of incorporating state-dependence in the metric, and investigate underlying reasons for observed sPoA trends using heuristic metrics for agent behavior.
